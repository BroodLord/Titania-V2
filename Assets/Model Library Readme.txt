Model Library
=============

A library of models for use in your projects


License
-------
These models are licensed for UCLAN use only - you may only use these models for your university work. You must not distribute these models. However, you may demonstrate projects using these models as long as you note that it was part of your university work.

These models have been licensed through TurboSquid (www.turbosquid.com). TurboSquid has a range of other models, many of which are cheap or even free. We recommend TurboSquid to source models for your personal projects.


Notes
-----

- Each model is provided in Maya (.mb) and DirectX (.x) formats
- Some models have other formats too depending on their original form

- Scale is 1 unit to 1 meter unless stated otherwise below
- Models have all been scaled to realistic sizes - please report any mis-sized models

- Textures are JPEG (.jpg) or Targa (.tga) files, with a couple of Windows Bitmap files (.bmp)
- 32-bit Targa files are used where a texture has an alpha channel (for transparency)

- Textures with alpha channels or 2-sided textures will not render correctly in the DirectX viewer

- Most models have their own folder with their textures, although Some textures are repeated on several models
- Some models use shared folders, you may need to look at the .x file to find individual texture use
